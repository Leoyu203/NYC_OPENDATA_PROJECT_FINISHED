				<p style="border-style:double;border-radius:25px;padding:15px;">This dataset contains all job applications submitted through the Borough Offices, through eFiling, or through the HUB, which have a "Latest Action Date" since January 1, 2000. Most of the data elements in this dataset are pulled directly from the applicant's original PW-1 form job application and are not updated as details change throughout the plan review process.

        <p style="border-style:double;border-radius:25px;padding:15px;">The importance and relevance of the dataset is giving people information about the Department of Buildings issues permitting for construction and demolition activities in the City of New York. There are many permit types, such as construction, boiler, elevator, and plumbing. The primary permit applications, also called job applications, are: New Building, Demolition, and Alterations Type-1, 2, and 3. The proper job application may depend upon whether the work will change the propertyâ€™s use, egress or occupancy. The datasets that we used were maps and charts about job application filings based on the Boroughs.
